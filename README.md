> [!WARNING]
> This module and system is still in early development, is not feature complete or bug free. Please report all issues/bugs/feedback on [Github Issues](https://github.com/metamancer/os/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-desc)

## Installation

We're still under heavy development; as things change, your games may break or have adverse impact. Please keep this in mind and backup your character/world data frequently. This module is built directly on top of the LiTM system for ease of functionality and code maintainance. You will need to have that system installed before this module will function in your VTT. Instructions below.

**To install the system in Foundry Virtual Tabletop:**

1. Install Legend in the Mist (if you don't have yet). Copy and paste this manifest into the "Install System" Prompt
   
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMediocreDad/os/main/system.json
```

2. Copy and paste this manifest into the "Install Module" Prompt

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metamancer/os/main/module.json
```

3. Create a new world using the "Legend in the Mist" system.
   
4. Turn on the "Otherscape" Module from within your game.

5. Play and report any bugs or issues on [Github](https://github.com/metamancer/os/issues).

> [!NOTE]
> If you like the game consider becoming a late backer on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonofoak/tokyo-otherworld-a-mythic-cyberpunk-rpg), and if you're interested in a Fantasy genre using the same rules engine, check out Legend in the Mist on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonofoak/legend-in-the-mist-rpg).
