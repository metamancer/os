## Installation

We're still under extremely heavy development; as things change, your games may break or have adverse impact. Please keep this in mind and backup your character/world data frequently. This system is built directly from the code supporting the [Legends in the Mist system](https://github.com/aMediocreDad/os) by [aMediocreDad](https://github.com/aMediocreDad), with his permission.

**To install the system in Foundry Virtual Tabletop:**

1. Copy and paste this manifest into the "Install System" Prompt

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metamancer/os/main/system.json
```

3. Create a new world using the ":Otherscape" system.
   
4. Play and report any bugs/issues on [Github](https://github.com/metamancer/os/issues) or join the discussion on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XwJe4QWyfy)!

> [!NOTE]
> If you like the game consider becoming a late backer on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonofoak/tokyo-otherworld-a-mythic-cyberpunk-rpg), and if you're interested in a Fantasy genre using the same rules engine, check out Legend in the Mist on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonofoak/legend-in-the-mist-rpg).
