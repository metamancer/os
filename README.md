## Installation

Thanks for wanting to try out this system. While still under heavy development, as things change your games may break or have adverse impact. Please keep this in mind and backup your character/world data frequently. 

**To install the system in Foundry Virtual Tabletop:**

1. Copy and paste this manifest into Foundry Virtual Tabletop's "Install System" Prompt

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metamancer/os/main/system.json
```

2. Create a new world using the "Otherscape" system.

3. Play the game and report any bugs on [Github](https://github.com/metamancer/os/issues).

> [!NOTE]
> If you like the game consider becoming a late backer on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonofoak/tokyo-otherworld-a-mythic-cyberpunk-rpg), and if you're interested in a Fantasy genre using the same rules engine, check out Legend in the Mist on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonofoak/legend-in-the-mist-rpg).
